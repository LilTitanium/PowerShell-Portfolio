# Portfolio
This is the directory of my past work that I have done in the previously.
My portfolio of PowerShell work that I have done for companies and organizations. In addition, this portfolio is used for education purposes so my colleagues and students can learn from my PowerShell scripts that I have created and how it is applied to real-world projects for companies and organizations. Professors are welcome to incorporate my PowerShell scripts into their course curriculum.

At the end of the day, I want this repository to be used as an educational resource for individuals who want to learn coding in PowerShell to enhance their technical skillset so they can be more prepared for the real world.
